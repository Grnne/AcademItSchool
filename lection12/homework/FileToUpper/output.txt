NOW I SHALL SPY ON BEAUTY AS NONE HAS
SPIED ON IT YET. NOW I SHALL CRY OUT AS
NONE HAS CRIED OUT. NOW I SHALL TRY WHAT NONE
HAS TRIED. NOW I SHALL DO WHAT NONE HAS DONE.

AND SPEAKING OF THIS WONDERFUL MACHINE:
I'M PUZZLED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
TWO METHODS OF COMPOSING: A, THE KIND
WHICH GOES ON SOLELY IN THE POET'S MIND,
A TESTING OF PERFORMING WORDS, WHILE HE
IS SOAPING A THIRD TIME ONE LEG, AND B,
THE OTHER KIND, MUCH MORE DECOROUS, WHEN
HE'S IN HIS STUDY WRITING WITH A PEN.

IN METHOD B THE HAND SUPPORTS THE THOUGHT,
THE ABSTRACT BATTLE IS CONCRETELY FOUGHT.
THE PEN STOPS IN MID-AIR, THEN SWOOPS TO BAR
A CANCELED SUNSET OR RESTORE A STAR,
AND THUS IT PHYSICALLY GUIDES THE PHRASE
TOWARD FAINT DAYLIGHT THROUGH THE INKY MAZE.
BUT METHOD A IS AGONY! THE BRAIN
IS SOON ENCLOSED IN A STEEL CAP OF PAIN.
A MUSE IN OVERALLS DIRECTS THE DRILL
WHICH GRINDS AND WHICH NO EFFORT OF THE WILL
CAN INTERRUPT, WHILE THE AUTOMATON
IS TAKING OFF WHAT HE HAS JUST PUT ON
OR WALKING BRISKLY TO THE CORNER STORE
TO BUY THE PAPER HE HAS READ BEFORE.

WHY IS IT SO? IS IT, PERHAPS, BECAUSE
IN PENLESS WORK THERE IS NO PEN-POISED PAUSE
AND ONE MUST USE THREE HANDS AT THE SAME TIME,
HAVING TO CHOOSE THE NECESSARY RHYME,
HOLD THE COMPLETED LINE BEFORE ONE'S EYES,
AND KEEP IN MIND ALL THE PRECEDING TRIES?
OR IS THE PROCESS DEEPER WITH NO DESK
TO PROP THE FALSE AND HOIST THE POETESQUE?

FOR THERE ARE THOSE MYSTERIOUS MOMENTS WHEN
TOO WEARY TO DELETE, I DROP MY PEN;
I AMBULATE - AND BY SOME MUTE COMMAND
THE RIGHT WORD FLUTES AND PERCHES ON MY HAND.
MY BEST TIME IS THE MORNING; MY PREFERRED
SEASON, MIDSUMMER. I ONCE OVERHEARD
MYSELF AWAKENING WHILE HALF OF ME
STILL SLEPT IN BED. I TORE MY SPIRIT FREE,
AND CAUGHT UP WITH MYSELF - UPON THE LAWN
WHERE CLOVER LEAVES CUPPED THE TOPAZ OF DAWN,
AND WHERE SHADE STOOD IN NIGHTSHIRT AND ONE SHOE.

AND THEN I REALIZED THAT THIS HALF TOO
WAS FAST ASLEEP; BOTH LAUGHED AND I AWOKE
SAFE IN MY BED AS DAY ITS EGGSHELL BROKE,
AND ROBINS WALKED AND STOPPED, AND ON THE DAMP
GEMMED TURF A BROWN SHOE LAY! MY SECRET STAMP,
THE SHADE IMPRESS, THE MYSTERY INBORN.
MIRAGES, MIRACLES, MIDSUMMER MORN.
